"""
PO Cost Changes — pandas pipeline for the new TicketVault DB export.

This is the v2 source: a single-header sheet (one row per ticket-group line)
with richer fields than the old PO_Cost_Changes.xlsm export. The reader
(`_read_one`) normalizes each new file into the exact internal schema the
proven pipeline already expects, so the transform / Bills / Expenses / Summary
logic below is unchanged from the original Section1.m port (see ../docs).

Differences from v1, by design:
  * No Purchase Details uploads. The new export carries its own
    PurchaseDetailMatchFound flag, but per spec we IGNORE it and process all
    rows. Row exclusion is driven solely by the manual "Remove" = X flag.
  * Total Adjustment is DERIVED = TicketCostTotal - InitialTicketCostTotal
    (End - Start); the source no longer ships an explicit adjustment column.
  * AdjustedDateTimeUTC is in UTC; we convert to US Central before taking the
    date used for bucketing and the date-range badge.
