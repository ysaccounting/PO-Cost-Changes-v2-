"""Major-league teams lookup from data/major_league_teams.xlsx.

Used by the team-rename vendor rule: if a row's Vendor is one of the
TEAM_RENAME_VENDORS (e.g. 'Ticketmaster AM', 'Tickets.com', 'Ballpark')
and Team/Performer is one of these teams, rename the Vendor to the
Team/Performer. Otherwise leave Vendor unchanged.

File schema: two columns 'League', 'Team'. We only care about Team.
Membership is case-insensitive — we lowercase both the lookup set and
the input.
